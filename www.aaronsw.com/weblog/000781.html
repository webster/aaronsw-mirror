<div class="content">
<p>Sadly, people keep talking about how wireless networks are &#8220;insecure&#8221; and &#8220;open to attack&#8221; and how we should secure them, to keep people out. In fact, we should do just the opposite: we should secure them to let people in.</p>

<p>When you ask someone why they don&#8217;t like you using your network, they&#8217;re usually concerned about people doing one of three things:</p><ul><li>breaking into their computers</li><li>eavesdropping on what they do</li><li>or preventing them from using the Internet</li></ul><p>I don&#8217;t think anyone really wants to keep people from the Internet; they just want to protect themselves. The funny thing is that base stations could be built that did securely protect their owners from these things.</p>

<p>Base stations could be configured to talk only to the router, and not let public users access the Ethernet network or specially-permitted users. Base stations could use real public-key cryptography to identify users that are specially-permitted and protect their conversations from eavesdropping. And base stations could use automatic traffic shaping to prevent the traffic from public users from interfering with that of specially permitted users.</p>

<p>I hope that future base stations contain strong, secure, easy-to-use solutions to these problems soon. No one should have to choose between being friendly and being safe.</p>
