<div class="content">
<p>It is now my birthday. In the US, we have a tradition that when you blow out the candles on your birthday cake, you should make a wish. Every year, as far back as I can remember, I&#8217;ve wished that I would see another birthday. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m afraid of dying, I just liked living.</p>

<p>Living is definitely harder now than it was then, but it&#8217;s also more rewarding. It&#8217;s been incredible to work with so many interesting people on so many great things. It&#8217;s also been difficult, stressful, and painful. But I press on, and continue looking for ways to improve. </p>

<p>On the bright side, my food, clothing, and shelter are taken care of so I&#8217;m not <a href="../../external.html?link=http://advogato.org/person/Bram/diary.html?start=39">a starving artist programmer</a> nor do I <a href="../../external.html?link=http://advogato.org/person/garym/diary.html?start=20">want to drive fork-lifts</a> because <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.treedragon.com/ged/map/ti/newAug02.htm#27aug02-valuing-hobbies">my family doesn&#8217;t appreciate my work</a>.</p>

<p>So thanks, to my family and friends. Wes, who has taught me more than I can remember, punched me (in a friendly way) and <a href="../../external.html?link=http://lessig.org/blog/">Lessig</a>, who has given me far more than I could possibly deserve, reminded me that it&#8217;s my birthday where he is &#8220;but remember, not yet in california. forgive them for their slowness.&#8221; I do.</p>
