<p>Tony Collen: <a href="../../external.html?link=http://radio.weblogs.com/0100630/2002/01/13.html#a12">&#8220;Personally, I think that kids need to be in high school with their peers, or they&#8217;ll grow up weird.&#8221;</a><p /><p />I guess it all depends on how you define weird. <p /><p /><a href="../../external.html?link=http://purl.org/net/sbp/">Sean</a>: &#8220;I think that Tony Collen is weird.&#8221;<p /><p />I&#8217;m certainly not normal (and proud of it!) and I think the process of &#8220;socialization&#8221; in high school does more damage than good. It&#8217;s certainly important to be able to make friends and hold conversations, etc. However, the culture of high school often tends towards supressing differences and making everyone very much the same.<p /><p />It&#8217;s a culture of competition (who&#8217;s popular? who&#8217;s got the drugs? who&#8217;s got the money?) and one that&#8217;s very self-focused. And I think that&#8217;s pretty dangerous. To paraphrase John Holt: I&#8217;d take my kids out of school for the social reasons alone!</p>
