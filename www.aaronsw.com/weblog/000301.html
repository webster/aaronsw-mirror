<p>Introducing <a href="../books/index.html">Aaron Swartz: Books</a>, a section of my website with books I&#8217;ve read and their reviews.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been looking for the right way to keep track of all the books I read for a long time. I started several years ago with a simple word processing document, but that quickly grew constraining as the book list stretched to several pages. Soon after I switched to an AppleWorks &#8220;database&#8221; but that became too unwieldy and had no way to publish to the Web. Today I think I&#8217;ve finally found the solution to my problem.</p>

<p>It lies in a program called <a href="../../external.html?link=http://eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> by <a href="../../external.html?link=http://markbernstein.org/">Mark Bernstein</a> of <a href="../../external.html?link=http://eastgate.com/">Eastgate</a>. I just got the program yesterday and it&#8217;s an incredibly intuitive and useful way to store things. I started in on this project this morning and within in hours learned how to store all my book reviews in Tinderbox and provide a wonderful export of them to HTML with next/previous links and everything. It was incredibly simple. If I would have tried to do this with a database-backed website, my previous tool for these jobs, it would have taken me days or weeks. Thanks to Tinderbox, I can spend the rest of the day working on something else.</p>
