	<h1>Putting Books Online Increases Sales</h1>

<div class="content">
<p>Eric Flint <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.baen.com/library/palaver6.htm">writes about giving his books away</a> on the <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.baen.com/library/">Free Library</a> and how it has increased sales.</p>

<blockquote><cite>Mother of Demons</cite> began its life as a typical first novel, with very modest sales and sell-through. Today, it has better than average sales and much better than average sell-through-a change that took place <em>simultaneously</em> with the book being available for free online.</a>
[&#8230;]
Those people arguing the &#8220;encryption/enforcement&#8221; side of the debate NEVER come up with hard figures. Harlan Ellison, for instance, screams that he has &#8220;Lost sales!&#8221; because of piracy-but, to the best of my knowledge, has <em>never once</em> even tried to demonstrate that this is true.
[&#8230;]
[Many people wrote to me and] would mention their own experience with Napster. And, in <em>every</em> instance, stated that their purchases of CDs <em>increased</em> as a result of Napster.
</blockquote>

<p>Feel free to <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.baen.com/library/067187800X/067187800X__c_.htm">check out Mother of Demons</a> from the library, along with <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.baen.com/library/titles.htm">many other titles</a>. The Free Library has also spawned <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.readassist.org/">ReadAssist</a>, an organization dedicated to promoting <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.w3.org/WAI/">acessible</a> electronic books. In a previous article he ran <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.baen.com/library/palaver2.htm">a great rant from Jim Baen</a> about the horrors of PDF:</p>

<blockquote>I want my text to be whatever size I find comfortable!!! But with PDF you cannot do that. What you see is what you&#8230; see. And for some reason the designers always use a font that might be called Ten Point Terminal Myopic because it will print nicely on paper. Of course if you want to just read it on a screen, too bad. Squint.</blockquote>

<p>He also quoted <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.baen.com/library/palaver4.htm">Thomas Macauly</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Macaulay&#8217;s position, slightly modified, did become the basis of copyright law in the English speaking world. And remained so (at least in the US) for a century and a half — until, on a day of infamy just a few years ago, the Walt Disney Corporation and their stooges in Congress got the law changed to the modern law, which extends copyright for a truly absurd period of time. Which — those who forget history are doomed to repeat it — is a return to the position advocated by Macaulay&#8217;s (now long forgotten) opponent in the debate.</blockquote>
