<div class="content">
<p>A fascinating <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.itas.fzk.de/mahp/weber/merkle.htm">interview with Ralph Merkle</a>. Merkle invented what we now call public-key cryptography &#8212; the ability for two users to communicate securely over an insecure channel. He says he came up with the idea after attempting to prove it was impossible. &#8220;Once I realized the problem was in fact soluble, at least that it was clear that there was no proof that it was insoluble, things fell into place fairly quickly.&#8221; <em>Amazing.</em></p>

<p>He was pointed towards Diffie and Hellman and rejected from the ACM for not having any citations. &#8220;So I was not citing the prior literature on public key cryptography which, of course, did not exist.&#8221; The referree completely misunderstood the paper. &#8220;So I think basically what happened is: my paper was rejected until the concepts were made popular, and then the referee clearly heard about the concept somewhere else and then decided: &#8216;Okay, seeing as how I already know the concepts, I can now announce that this paper is a fine paper.&#8217; So, by the by, I am a supporter of the Web. I think the World-wide Web is a fine idea. And self-publication electronically is splendid, and lets you by-pass all of this nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there&#8217;s <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.itas.fzk.de/mahp/weber/diffie.htm">an interview with Whitfield Diffie</a> in which he says that PKC came about while thinking of how to encrypt telephone conversations. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t take ourselves lightly, if we were interested, our thinking about something was important.&#8221; When he heard about the paperless office, he wondered about how people would sign documents &#8212; thus, digital signatures. When he heard that Merkle was thinking about the problem, he got more interested.  &#8220;I was very strongly influenced by [the do-it-yourself approach of the hackers at MIT] and that was very big in the Artificial Intelligence Lab.&#8221;</p>

<p>He also mentions <a href="../../external.html?link=http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/18750/0">The First Ten Years of Public-Key Cryptography</a> &#8212; I&#8217;ll have to look for that.</p>
