<div class="content">
<p>As of late I&#8217;ve been trying to learn how to design well. I went thru a suite of <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.ratz.com/robin/books.html">Robin Williams books</a> and started doing a few projects. I&#8217;m decent at black and white and eager to learn the intracacies of color.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I was blown away when I received my copy of <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/LiteraryMachines.html">Literary Machines</a> (Yes, I am a Ted Nelson fanboy). The printed invoice and postcard that came with was done with incredibly beautiful typography and layout. I can only imagine what their hypertexts might look like were they free from the restraints of these media.</p>

<div style="text-align: center; background: #ffd; color: #930; padding: 10px; border: 1px dotted #c30; font:	30px/1.5 TembleITC TT, serif;">Where&#8217;s our CSS future?</div>

<p>I hoped CSS would solve these problems, but I&#8217;m afraid I was wrong. Maybe it&#8217;s a lack of <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.w3.org/Fonts/">font support</a> or <a href="../../external.gif?link=http://www.omnigroup.com/images/applications/omniweb/Source.jpg">anti-aliasing browsers</a>. All I know is I can&#8217;t wait for the day when web pages are just as beautiful, if not more, than printed works.</p>

<p>Speaking of Eastgate, I can&#8217;t wait to play with <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a> but I&#8217;ve made a pact with myself not to buy it until they come out with an OS X version. It&#8217;s hard to keep because I keep thinking of new things to use it for (run this weblog, <a href="../../external.html?link=http://logicerror.com/">LogicError</a>, keep track of the books I&#8217;ve read and am reading, etc.).</p>
