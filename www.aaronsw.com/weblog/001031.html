	<h1>What A Little Bug Can Do</h1>

<div class="content">
<p>(Update 2003-09-05: I’m feeling pretty much all better, although my balance is a little shakey.)</p>

<p>On Friday I had my first day of school. On Saturday my skin became <a href="000904.html">hypersensitive again</a>. On Sunday it slowly got better but I noticed I had a navigation problem where my head thought I was about 15 degrees more downward than I really was. This didn’t really affect anything and was sort of fun, so I pretty much ignored it.. Yesterday (Monday) I went to school again and it all pretty much went away except for a tension headache/neckache that came on strongly that night.</p>

<p>Late last night I was reading something close on my computer screen. I leaned back and everything changed.</p>

<p>Apparently something in my brain’s navigational system blew. It seems to think everything is falling to the right. It tells my eyes to continually move quickly to the right. When I walk, it tries to pull me all over the place. The combination of the two trips my nausea sensor and makes me throw up anything I might still have in my stomach. And when I move my head to the right, it feels like a giant superfast <em>whoosh</em>. When I move it to the left it takes extra effort.</p>

<p>Hopefully the doctor will be able to help. Until then, excuse my absence, this constant eye movement makes it hard to do much.</p>
