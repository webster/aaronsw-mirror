<div class="content">
<p>There have been a lot of questions about CSS and its uses in the last few weeks, so I thought I&#8217;d throw in my two cents. Basically, it&#8217;s just a system for controlling the look of your site. Like server-side templates languages and content management systems, CSS lets users modify the look of their whole site by changing one file. In short, CSS is a system of client-side rendering rules. Let&#8217;s break this down&#8230;</p>

<p>CSS is client-side. This means it can do things that server-side systems can&#8217;t, or usually don&#8217;t. CSS lets users choose how they want the page to look using <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.alistapart.com/stories/alternate/">alternate stylesheets</a>, let&#8217;s you adjust settings based on <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/media.html">media types</a> (desktop, handheld, telephone, television, etc.), allows users to override settings with <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2000/07/21/magazine/css_anarchist.html">user stylesheets</a> (making the default font size bigger, get rid of ad banners, etc.).</p>

<p>CSS is a rendering language, which means that it changes the look of the page. Often this will be done by the templating languages in CMSs like <a href="../../external.html?link=http://radio.userland.com/">Radio</a>, <a href="../../external.html?link=http://manila.userland.com/">Manila</a> or <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a>. Because it&#8217;s separated from the HTML, you can continue writing your web pages like you always have, and a special CSS designer (even one who doesn&#8217;t have write access to your website!) can work on the graphic design. Although, in my experience, CSS&#8217; ease-of-use has allowed me (and I am terrible at designing sites) to create some decent-looking pages.</p>

<p>CSS is unlike most templating languages in that it&#8217;s rules-based. Like the <a href="../../external.html?link=http://frontier.userland.com/stories/storyReader$3469">pikeRenderer rules</a>, you provide a bunch of attributes (font-family, color, weight, text-decoration) and apply them to a bunch of elements (specifications for sets of HTML tags). CSS even lets you change little things like the size of an &lt;h2> header or the background color of a link. You can do all of this without modifying the HTML at all, letting the HTML simply store the content and CSS take care of the presentation.</p>

<p>CSS has it&#8217;s flaws of course: it can&#8217;t rearrange the structure or order of a page, it doesn&#8217;t let you add content like logos or navigation bars and it has compatibility problems in some browsers. But despite it&#8217;s flaws, it&#8217;s a very useful tool for those who want greater control over the look of their website. I hope that others find it as useful as I do.</p>
