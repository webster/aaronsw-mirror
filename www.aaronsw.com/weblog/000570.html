<div class="content">
<p>I admit it. I was one of those suc^H^H^Hcool people who bought a .mac account. Apple sent an update today that has lots of cool stuff, including a note that says I can buy up to five email-only accounts for $10 a piece. I know there were lots of people complaining that they&#8217;d have to pay $50 for to keep their email address.</p>

<p>Well now you only need to pay ten. If you send it to me, I&#8217;ll buy one for you. Let me know.</p>
