	<h1>Counter-terrorizing Osama</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Larry Lessig: <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.redherring.com/insider/2002/09/codification091002.html">Anti-trusting Microsoft</a>. &#8220;Microsoft has a John Cleese problem. Again and again, it has been accused of anticompetitive behavior. Again and again, it has denied it. [&#8230;] Thus, quite understandably, the world trembles every time Microsoft moves. [&#8230;] The fury about Microsoft&#8217;s June announcement of Palladium is a perfect example. [&#8230;] If you sent a Palladium-equipped machine an email, but told it not to forward the email, the machine would obey the restriction. [&#8230;] And for anyone who&#8217;s had an email turn up somewhere it shouldn&#8217;t, this type of control doesn&#8217;t sound all bad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aaron Swartz: <a href="../2002/counterTerrorizing.html">Counter-terrorizing Osama</a>. &#8220;Osama has a John Cleese problem. Repeatedly he has blown up ships, buildings and boats and each time he has escaped capture. Thus, quite understandably, the world trembles every time Osama moves. [&#8230;] The fury about his announcement of randomized American kidnappings is a perfect example. If it works as designed, Osama&#8217;s agents will begin stealing children from homes all over America. And for anyone who has tried to keep their children from looking at adult websites, this doesn&#8217;t sound all bad.&#8221;</p>
