	<h1>Announcing Decisions</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>Unless you&#8217;ve been living in Redmond for the past day, you know that the District Court of D.C. <a href="../../external.html?link=http://slashdot.org/articles/02/11/01/2034207.shtml?tid=123">has let Microsoft off with a slap on the wrist</a>. Looks like the court fully accepted <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/22684.html">the swiss cheese settlement</a>. There&#8217;s always appeal.</p>

<p>I found the results because (due to a strange coincidence&#8212;I very rarely visit slashdot) I happened to visit /. seconds after they posted the story (no comments had been posted when I was there), which was an hour earlier than the decision was actually released. I also subscribed to get <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/microsoft-2001-email.html">the decision by email</a> and had the radio on (NPR announced it during their 3:30PM news break).</p>

<p>But what about the Supreme Court? How does one get the opinion in the Eldred case? Lessig writes explaining that the court usually announces opinions before oral argument (<a href="../../external.html?link=http://oyez.org/dynaram.cgi?case_id=1302&amp;resource=opinion.rm">example (RealAudio)</a> from <a href="../../external.html?link=http://oyez.org/cases/cases.cgi?case_id=1302">Lopez v. Davis</a>&#8212;I wonder if it&#8217;s the same Lopez from <a href="../../external.html?link=http://oyez.org/cases/cases.cgi?case_id=642">United States v. Lopez</a>; both involved guns). He says he&#8217;ll also get a call beforehand.</p>

<p>The court has <a href="../../external.html?link=http://supremecourtus.gov/publicinfo/phonenumbers.html">several telephone numbers</a> including <a href="tel:+12024793360">one for opinion announcements</a>. I called and got a recorded message stating (in part): &#8220;Today is Friday, November first. We will be releasing [&#8230;] opinions on Tuesday, November 5th.&#8221; I&#8217;ll try to remember to call again on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The court also has a document on <a href="../../external.html?link=http://supremecourtus.gov/opinions/obtainopinions.pdf">where to obtain opinions</a>. The first draft (bench) opinion is available electronically through the subscription-only Project Hermes. Luckily, it appears that <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.law.cornell.edu/focus/bulletins.html">Cornell Law School provides an email list where they distribute summaries (syllabi) of the decisions &#8220;hours after their release&#8221;</a> with links to the full decision. I subscribed to that too.</p>
