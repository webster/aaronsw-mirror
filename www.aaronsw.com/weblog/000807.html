<p><a href="../2002/i-want-to-believe.jpg"><img src="../2002/i-want-to-believe-small.jpg" class="img" alt="I WANT TO BELIEVE poster" /></a>Larry Lessig: <a href="../../external.html?link=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/lessig/blog/archives/2003_01.shtml#000869">the silent 5</a>. &#8216;Is there a principle here? Is there a way to read these opinions as consistent with a principle? [&#8230;] Think the poster on the X-Files &#8212; &#8220;I want to believe&#8221; &#8212; but with the Supreme Court, not UFOs, in the background.&#8217;</p>

<p>This reminds me of some thoughts I had on the harmonization argument. I understood the argument to be &#8220;Country X has longer copyrights than we do. Authors want longer copyrights. If our copyright isn&#8217;t as along as X&#8217;s then all the authors will move to X.&#8221; But this doesn&#8217;t make sense at all! Copyright length depends on the country of the <em>reader</em> not the <em>author</em>. </p>

<p>A much more sane harmonization argument would be &#8220;Country Y has shorter copyrights than we do. Readers want shorter copyrights. If our copyright isn&#8217;t as short as Y&#8217;s then all the readers will move to Y.&#8221; This would cause copyright lengths to keep getting shorter, not longer.</p>

<p>On that note, anyone know a nice country with a short copyright term?</p>
