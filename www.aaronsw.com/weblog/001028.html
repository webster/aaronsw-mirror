	<h1>Day, Today</h1>
</div>

<div class="content">
<p>I got up three hours early this morning to record a fifteen minute interview which will be cut down to a three minute piece for <a href="../../external.html?link=http://npr.org/programs/day/">NPR’s Day to Day</a>. It’s about worms and viruses and aired today: <a href="../../external.html?link=http://www.npr.org/rundowns/segment.php?wfId=1404254">Hacker Culture and Computer Viruses</a>. From a quick listen I sound pretty bad, but not too bad. I noticed my hand was shaking throughout the interview.</p>

<p>I’m not sure how they found me, but I bet it’s <a href="../../external.html?link=http://craphound.com/">Cory</a>’s fault. Xeni <a href="../../external.html?link=http://boingboing.net/2003_08_01_archive.html#200443953">wrote a bit about them on BoingBoing</a>: “The show as only been on the air for a few weeks, but they’re doing some really interesting coverage on blogs, emerging technology, and how the geek world impacts pop culture in general. It’s a great program so far, and I’m looking forward to watching how it grows. I was on the show today [&#8230;]”.</p>

<p>I think it’s good that they’re covering this stuff, but sometimes I wish news orgs covered a little more of the technology rather than the social aspects. I’m mindful of <a href="../../external.html?link=http://perl.plover.com/qrpff/">mjd’s warning about Wired</a>: “I knew that no matter how little informative content I actually included, it would be too much—they would assiduously remove all actual information from my article, and the result would be a piece which would give the reader a warm fealing of having understood, but without actually imparting anything else of value.  That’s what Wired is about: The illusion of knowledge without any of the difficult bits.”</p>
